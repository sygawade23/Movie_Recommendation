# Movie_Recommendation
The provided code appears to be a simple movie recommendation system using content-based filtering. It recommends similar movies to the one provided by the user based on selected features such as genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director. Let's go through the code with comments explaining each step:
The code uses TF-IDF vectorization to represent each movie's features as numerical vectors and then calculates the cosine similarity between these vectors to find similar movies. It takes user input for their favorite movie and recommends similar movies based on the selected features available in the dataset. However, please note that the dataset and its features greatly influence the quality of recommendations, and in a real-world scenario, more sophisticated recommendation techniques and user feedback would be necessary to improve the recommendations further.
